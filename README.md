# 3R-Robotic-Manipulator
By developing this project we will know How to perform the forward kinematics of the 3-DOF planar robot of given DH parameters using Robo Analyzerâ€”plotting the values of the end-effector coordinates. Calculating the end-effector position for a given set of shared values, using transformation matrices, and verifying with Robo Analyzer.
Kinematic analysis of the 3DOF 3R robot was simulated using Robo Analyzer software.
At the end of this project, we came to a clear understanding of Robo Analyzer Software.
By using Robo Analyzer we obtained forward kinematics of the end effector of the robot for 
the given joint parameters.
By using graphs in robo analyzer software we analyzed the change in joint angles with 
respect to time and also the change in joint velocities with respect to time.
By inputting the link lengths and desired coordinates and angle of the end effector we 
obtained solutions for inverse kinematics and calculated DH parameters theoretically and that 
obtained matrix of the end effector was matched with the updated matrix of DH parameters in 
Robo Analyzer.
