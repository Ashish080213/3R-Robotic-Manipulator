# 3R-Robotic-Manipulator
By developing this project we will know How to perform the forward kinematics of the 3-DOF planar robot of given DH parameters using Robo Analyzerâ€”plotting the values of the end-effector coordinates. Calculating the end-effector position for a given set of shared values, using transformation matrices, and verifying with Robo Analyzer.
